# Bat's Freak Fortress Edit
## An unoffical edit of the Freak Fortress 2 plugin found here: https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official


### Installiton and Setup:
The download does not include boss configs, models, or sub-plugins. It is recommended that you install the offical Freak Fortress
1.10.14 (https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/releases/tag/1.10.14) before installing this edit on it. This edit also generates some
new cvars so save a backup of cfg/sourcemod/FreakFortress2.cfg and delete it, this edit will generate a new one. After running, you can
freely readd the cvars you had previously, some may not be their like Ullapool Caber detentions. (See the Wiki)
**All non-boss config (eg. characters.cfg, doors.cfg, and maps.cfg) need to go in addons/sourcemod/data/freak_fortress_2/**
