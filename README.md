# Bat's Freak Fortress Edit
## An unoffical edit of the Freak Fortress 2 plugin found here: https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official


### Installiton and Setup:
The download does not include boss configs or models. It is recommended that you install the offical Freak Fortress 1.10.14
(https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/releases/tag/1.10.14) before replacing some parts with this edit. This edit also generates
some new cvars so save a backup of cfg/FreakFortress2.cfg and delete it, this edit will generate a new one. After running, you can
freely readd the cvars you had previously, some may not be their like RTD and Caber detentions. (See the Wiki)
### ALL NON-BOSS CONFIGS (eg. characters.cfg, doors.cfg, and maps.cfg) NEED TO GO IN data/freak_fortress_2/
