# Bat's Freak Fortress Edit
## A mixture of various popular plugins for FF2 and extra setting to give the best out of bosses and small community servers

### Installiton and Setup:
The download does not include boss configs, models, or sub-plugins. It is recommended that you install the offical Freak Fortress 1.10.14
(https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/releases/tag/1.10.14) before installing this edit on it. **To install this edit, download both
the Source code and smx files in releases.** This edit also generates some new cvars so save a backup of cfg/sourcemod/FreakFortress2.cfg
and delete it, this edit will generate a new one. After running, you can freely readd the cvars you had previously, some may not be
there like Ullapool Caber detentions. (See the Wiki)
**All non-boss config (eg. characters.cfg, doors.cfg, and maps.cfg) need to go in addons/sourcemod/data/freak_fortress_2/**
